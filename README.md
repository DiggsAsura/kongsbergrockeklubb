# Kongsberg Rockeklubb

*21 June 2022*  
**Kongsberg Rockeklubb** (rock club, an organisation, not an actual club) rises from the 
ashes and reached out to have a homepage made. As of yet, no real pointers, but i'm at least
prepping a repo for it. 

Site should mainly focus around upcomig arrangements.

Might need/want a small backend to let them add stuff to the program page by themselfs, 
and/or general info page. Ofc this could be done in Wordpress or whatnot, but I'll do it
from scratch. 

For the backend, Python/Flask I guess. Then maybe later pivot to Rust and WASM which is
more in line of where I want to go. HTML and CSS for the frontend. Try to avoid JavaScript 
if possible.
